Restaurant Analysis - Restaurant Recommendation System

Recommendation systems are a popular application of machine learning that aim to suggest items of interest to users based on their preferences and behaviors. With the explosive growth of data in recent years, recommendation systems have become increasingly important in various domains such as e-commerce, social media, and entertainment. One of the key challenges in building a recommendation system is to develop effective algorithms that can accurately predict user preferences and provide personalized recommendations.
Eating out has become an essential part of modern culture, with people often choosing to dine at restaurants for convenience, socialization, or special occasions. However, with the sheer number of restaurants available in most areas, it can be challenging to choose the right one.
Our motivation for undertaking this project stems from the need to enhance the restaurant recommendation system by incorporating a more comprehensive and personalized approach. We recognized the limitations of existing systems that often overlook crucial factors such as ratings, reviews, and the significance of location-based preferences. This led us to embark on a project that aims to bridge these gaps and provide users with more accurate and tailored restaurant recommendations.
